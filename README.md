# Scientific Calculator

A modern scientific calculator with a beautiful dark-themed UI built using Python and customtkinter.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Scientific functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Logarithmic functions (log, ln)
- Constants (π, e)
- Memory functions (MC, MR, M+, M-)
- Square and cube operations
- Square root
- Parentheses support
- Clear and backspace functionality
- Sign toggle (±)

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the calculator:
```bash
python calculator.py
```

### Basic Operations
- Use the number pad (0-9) to input numbers
- Use the operation buttons (+, -, *, /) for basic arithmetic
- Press "=" to calculate the result
- Press "C" to clear the display
- Press "⌫" for backspace
- Press "±" to toggle between positive and negative numbers

### Scientific Functions
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) work with degrees
- Use "√" for square root
- Use "x²" for square and "x³" for cube
- Use "log" for base-10 logarithm and "ln" for natural logarithm
- Use "π" to input pi and "e" to input Euler's number

### Memory Functions
- "MC" - Memory Clear
- "MR" - Memory Recall
- "M+" - Memory Add
- "M-" - Memory Subtract

## Note
The calculator uses degrees for trigonometric functions. Make sure to input angles in degrees when using sin, cos, or tan functions.
